#Dictionaries - a dictionary is an unordered set of key-value pairs

# It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the 
# requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces 
# creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value 
# pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is 
# also the way dictionaries are written on output.

dict1 = {} #creating an empty dictionary

dict1 = {"Vendor": "Cisco", "Model": "2600", "IOS": "12.4", "Ports": "4"}

dict1["IOS"] #returns "12.4"; extracting a value for a specified key

dict1["IOS"] = "12.3" #modifies an existing key-value pair

dict1["RAM"] = "128" #adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary

del dict1["Ports"] #deleting a key-value pair from the dictionary

len(dict1) #returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary

"IOS" in dict1 #verifies if "IOS" is a key in the dictionary

"IOS2" not in dict1 #verifies if "IOS2" is not a key in the dictionary

#Dictionaries - methods
dict1.keys() #returns a list having the keys in the dictionary as elements

dict1.values() #returns a list having the values in the dictionary as elements

dict1.items() #returns a list of tuples, each tuple containing the key and value of each dictionary pair
